# Expense Tracker
A simple React.js expense tracking app, a practice project for [React - The Complete Guide 2023 (incl. React Router & Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) course on Udemy.

# Run the project locally

1. Clone the project

`git clone [link]`


2. Install the dependencies

`npm install`


3. Start the server

`npm run dev`

# Technologies Used 

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for bundling and faster dev environment. 

Wil probably rewrite the components using the [MUI library](https://mui.com/material-ui/) at a later stage. 

Wil probably rewrite the whole project in TS or create a new one altogether.

Want to introduce Unit Testing.
